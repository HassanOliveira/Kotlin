- Conditional structure**: `if` and `when`
- Repeating structure or loops**: `while` and `for` loop
- Class implementation**: account definition
- Creating objects**: instances for creating new accounts
- Constructors**: defining how to create objects
- Properties: mechanism for accessing fields/attributes of classes
- **Methods**: class behaviors
- Named parameters**: sending specific arguments to constructors, methods or functions
- Access methods**: restricting access to class members
